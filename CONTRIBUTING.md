# How To Contribute

Contributions to UI Components are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!

## Contribution Prerequisites

- You have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed at v8.0.0+.
- You are familiar with Git.

## Pull Requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language).

## Development Workflow

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Configure and install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a new branch from master: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
4. Make your changes and commit them.
5. Push your branch and open a pull-request going from your forked branch into master.

## Storybook

To view and interact with the available components, run one (or more) of the following:

```shell
npm run storybook:html
npm run storybook:react
```
